# How to edit and run this app

## How to make changes/add a feature

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `git pull`
Always run this first so you have the most up to date files to edit. Do it every time something new is pushed.

#### VS Code
Use Visual Studio to edit - make sure files are in appropriate folders

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Use this before pushing to github to make sure there are no errors!!!

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `git add .` 
to stage your changes

#### `git commit -m <message>`
to commit

#### `git push`
to push code to main branch

#### `npm run deploy`
